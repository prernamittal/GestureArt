# GestureArt
<i>"Gesture Art"</i> is a machine learning project that allows users to paint on a virtual canvas using gestures captured through a webcam. The project uses advanced computer vision algorithms to detect and interpret the user's gestures, allowing them to control the virtual brush with precision and ease. Whether you are an experienced artist or a beginner looking to try your hand at digital painting, <i>"Gesture Art"</i> is a fun and intuitive way to unleash your creativity.<br>

Color detection and segmentation techniques to achieve the objective of this project. Color detection is an image processing technique where we detect any color in a given range of HSV color space. Image segmentation is the process of labeling every pixel in an image, where each pixel shares the same characteristics. Here, green color is used to navigate and draw on the virtual canvas.<br>
